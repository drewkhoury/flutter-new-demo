# flutter-new-demo


Creating a new project: `flutter create demo`.

When adding packages to `pubspec.yaml`, you need to run `flutter pub get` to download the packages (your IDE may to this for you).

Run a specific group of tests from a file `flutter test test/counter_test.dart`.

Run all tests `flutter test`.

Runs tests, but shows one on each line `flutter test --reporter=expanded`.
